* Section introduction: reiterate our objectives
** [#A] what happened based on them (references) to get ethics clear
** Lessons for practice in computer science and specially HCI (add to all of them add 1.1) - "this is what happened and so what?"
* Current work on all of this [[1.1]]
** Aristotelian vs Platonic
** Kant and the categorical imperative
** David Hume on the problem of induction
** Maybe talk about the authors that break down cognitivism and agree or not - dualists, functionalists, materialists etc
** All of this connects to philosophy of mind. Maybe necessary?
** go deep maybe into pre-aristotle
* Think about taxonomic implication [[1.2]]
** Based on what's raised in 1.1, create a mindset framework for the rest of the paper, as this subsection was a small conclusion of this section and connect all of these x.2's throughout the whole paper
