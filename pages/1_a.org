* Aristotelian vs Platonic
* Kant and the categorical imperative
* David Hume on the problem of induction
* Maybe talk about the authors that break down cognitivism and agree or not - dualists, functionalists, materialists etc
* All of this connects to philosophy of mind. Maybe necessary?
* go deep maybe into pre-aristotle
