In the rest of this chapter, we describe the development of the
academic literature on peer production and collective intelligence in
three areas – organization, motivation, and quality. In each area, we
introduce foundational work consisting primarily of earlier
scholarship that sought to describe peer production and establish its
legitimacy. Subsequently, we characterize work, usually more recent,
that seeks to pursue new directions and to derive more nuanced
analytical insights. — https://mako.cc/benkler_shaw_hill-peer_production_ci.pdf
