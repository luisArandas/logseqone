#+title: Background


* When we talk about Human-Computer Co-Creativity, what are we talking about?
We want to establish the setting in which people can understand what we’re talking about.
* Bergson’s definition of creativity might be confusing for people, but it’s pretty much the one we need to address our RQ.

* Existing books about “creativity and ethics” don’t quite cut the mustard
** DOING Say why these aren’t sufficient answers to our questions
** "Creativity and Ethics"
** "Technology and the virtues: A philosophical guide to a future worth wanting"
