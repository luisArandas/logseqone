At this point our aim is to set up the framework for reviewers to
evaluate the paper’s contributions, not to dazzle them with esoteric

* *Philosophy*:
** - “Creative evolution” from Bergson
- “Anthropotechnics” from Sloterdijk.
- Proscurcin Jr., Der Begriff Ethos bei Homer. (2014) pp. 162–63 if someone can read German a bit
* *Anthropology*:
- “Chaîne opératoire” from André Leroi-Gourhan et al.
- Histories of the evolution of intelligence (*sociality* & tools being key focal points)
* *Computing*
- “Computational Social Creativity” is one sub-field of computing research that is apropos, because it considers creativity spread across a social field.
* Other fields:
- “Professional ethics” (e.g., with reference to medicine, physics, etc).
