#+TITLE: Case studies

** Assuming we hold on to this section, it allows us a deeper dive into some examples. Case studies would allow us to look at the concepts we've discussed in the previous sections in a real-world context. However, we’d want to be sure that these aren’t just “tacked on.” Possible examples:
*** Maybe robots?
*** [[file:mathematical_creativity.org][Mathematical creativity]] throughout time
*** Social machines
*** [[file:logseq_and_friends.org][Logseq and friends]] — This could be a good one because it relates to the primary tool that we're using for writing this paper
