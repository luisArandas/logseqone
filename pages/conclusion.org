#+TITLE: Conclusion

** "There is also now a clear consensus that ethical AI is the only sustainable way forward. The time has come for the Government to move from deciding what the ethics are, to how to instil them in the development and deployment of AI systems."  — I'm not sure that's how ethics work -JC
** *Further questions:* *1.1)* as a researcher how can I fit inside an ethical framework without disrupting my day-to-day way of work, that in itself guides me as a railway - and this day-to-day should also work within the following decades; **1.2)** how can this ethical framework overcome me as a CS male white european guy and still work for me as a CS male white european guy; **1.3)** Define what does it mean to design tech and CS thinking: what and if it is creativity as mirror of ethical principals?; **1.4)** define creativity as one of the possible considerations to take towards something *I* do inside the framework and that there should be a lot more of states that we can use that are not being creative;
** *Discourse around Ethical AI*  - maybe connect this to the conscious experience. (e.g.) the fact that GPT-3 doesn't understand anything about the world and possible future steps in mathematics/CS to tackle virtual *understanding* **supervised grammar induction**, the meaning of the words... "The bat broke the window". How can we get to the fundamental meaning of a word that in itself is a map of a thinking we will never access in the current state of human civilization (multiple mind agency connected to the theory and its limits).
** — such as by criticizing and improving so-called AI systems that currently have no cognitive understanding of the world
