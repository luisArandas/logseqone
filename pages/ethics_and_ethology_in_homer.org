#+TITLE: Ethics and Ethology in Homer

**
> Paris did not remain long in his house. He donned his goodly armor overlaid with bronze, and hastened through the city as fast as his feet could take him. As a horse, stabled and fed, breaks loose and gallops gloriously over the plain to the place where he is wont to bathe in the fair-flowing river - he holds his head high, and his mane streams upon his shoulders as he exults in his strength and flies like the wind to /the haunts and feeding ground of the mares/ â€” *trans.* Butler, 1898
