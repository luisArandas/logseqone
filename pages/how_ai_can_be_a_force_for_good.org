With distributed agency comes distributed responsibility. Existing ethical frameworks address individual, human responsibility, with the goal of allocating punishment or reward based on the actions and intentions of an individual. They were not developed to deal with distributed
responsibility.

** This seems like an important point: we'll need new (not necessarily "agential") ways to think about ethics.
** It seems useful to apply this in somewhat more general terms about "intelligent systems" â€” or just "systems with emergent properties"; so, if distributed agents produce e.g., environmental degradation, that's not ethical, and the system as a whole "should" find ways to improve its behaviour.  This sort of thing is thought about in Elinor Ostrom's economics.
