#+TITLE: Motivation

** - Distributed work
- Social network
- Hacker Manifesto from Mackenzie.. (*written like law*, a government can build from this; it's not ethical to use military drones, except in case X, bla bla bla); vs Daft Punk, disco, dressing as robots.  **ACM**
- How are the ethics actually deployed, e.g., parental controls
- "I am building software in 2025... how do I actually use this taxonomy?"
- This is a type of usability research...
- "You can't validate Foucault, he ruined people's lives, etc." — How do we *use* Foucault.  Philosophy won't give you an answer...
- Archeology of knowledge, laboratory life.  But now everyone has powerful data gathering tools.
- How to communicate culture (the right culture, and well)
- Typical answer: through observation. SN: tends towards a materialist approach. This is the most reliable.
- LA: Hans Weihinger ('aus ald', philosophy of 'as if' — Karl Friston uses this); judge from own lens; Thomas Nagel... view from no-where?
