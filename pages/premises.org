#+title: Premises

* We’ve entered into a new era, and we need to understand what’s going on.
* Although part of this is the legacy of the industrial revolution, computers have played a significant role in the growth of knowledge
* In a certain sense the CS field is playing “catch-up” with CMC: we invent new paradigms for interaction (e.g., Wikipedia, machine learning)
* However, we don’t yet have a robust way to /think/ about human computer interaction at this broad scale
* We try to wrap our minds around “Human-Computer Co-Creativity” by looking at CMC, HCI, and CI.
Let’s work our way up to discussing HCCC by starting with “human
co-creativity using computers”, and introduce AI once we have a grasp
of how computer mediated communication and collective intelligence
works.
