#+TITLE: Survey introduction

** Assuming we have the core concepts established, the survey section should be easy to write — I imagine a call ("A") and response ("B") setup. The (A) theme is to look at what people have said in various "philosophical" traditions — Western, nonwestern, phenomenological, experimental. The (B) theme is to look at how these traditions have been received within HCI and Computational Creativity research — if at all. In other words, this is a parallel survey of two different bodies of text, drawing connections between them. While there could be a lot of reading here, the writing part is basically procedural.  Furthermore, we could break down the tasks in different sub-sections to make it more focused. One nice model for this structure of writing is [[https://mako.cc/benkler_shaw_hill-peer_production_ci.pdf][Benkler, Shaw, and Hill]] Some methodological questions we can ask about the computing papers: do the papers consider ethics at all? Have they sought ethics approval?  Is ethics considered in only an immediate sense (like in a psychology experiment) or in a broader sense (e.g., free software)? We could also look at critical literature (e.g., dealing with AI bias). At the end of this section, we should understand the different extant practical approaches to ethics, and how they’re grounded in philosophy. We can use boundary lines like “HCI” and “co-creativity” as selection criteria to make sure that we don’t include everything.
